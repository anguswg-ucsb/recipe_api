## **Introduction** <a name="introduction"></a>

Welcome to the `PantryMatch` FastAPI REST API documentation. <br/>
You've stumbled upon the backend engine of the soon-to-be `PantryMatch` web application (currently undergoing a rigorous construction phase). Now, hold onto your chef's hat because, much like the `PantryMatch` web app, this API is still under construction. But fear not! We're working tirelessly to make this resource a reality. 
<br/>
<br/>

## **How It Works** <a name="how-it-works"></a>

`PantryMatch` is a dynamic web application designed to simplify the cooking experience for users by suggesting recipes based on the ingredients they have on hand. This API empowers the application's core functionality by efficiently processing user queries and delivering tailored recipe recommendations.

> ## **Database Schema** <a name="subparagraph3"></a>
> 
> Following the data preparation, the information was migrated into an AWS EC2-hosted Postgres database. Within this environment, it was strategically divided into tables to facilitate efficient and targeted query operations.
>  <br/>
> 
> The `dish_id` in `dish_table` serves as the primary key, while in `directions_table` and `quantities_table`, it functions as a foreign keyâ€”establishing a relationship between the tables. Additionally, the `unique_ingredients_table` operates independently and is unrelated to the other two, primarily serving for autocomplete functionality.
